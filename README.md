## MM2-Script-Data
Contains almost everything I have on MM2 level file editing. Contains Scripts, Documentation, Level Files, and more.

# MM2 Expanded Toolkit
Contains a set of basic golang scripts for level editing and analysis, as well as a MM2 Save file with edited level files. 

# Documentation
Contains any write-ups I've made following tests with level file editing (such as those about object flags), the scripts I used to conduct those tests, and the level file(s) I tested on. 


Credit to TheGreatRambler, Kramer, and the entire Open-Course-World/Level-Viewer team for all their preexisting reasearch up until now. Would not have been able to make any headway without Toost.
